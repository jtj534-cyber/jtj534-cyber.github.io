  <h2>Production diary – Week 15</h2>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> 13 February 2026</p>

  <p>
    This week I developed my GitHub Pages portfolio website and improved its structure.
    I added clear sections (About, Projects, Skills, and Contact) and made sure the site
    looks clean and easy to scan. I also created a CS Maths & Tools page and built a small
    JavaScript tool that converts decimal numbers into binary.
  </p>

  <p>
    The achievement I am most proud of is getting the binary converter working correctly,
    because it helped me understand how user input is processed in JavaScript and how binary
    relates to computer architecture.
  </p>

  <p>
    The most challenging part was using GitHub properly (committing changes, file naming,
    and making sure links work). I also needed time to understand where to place HTML
    elements so the layout stays neat.
  </p>

  <p>
    From this work I learned how HTML and CSS control structure and presentation, and how
    JavaScript can add interactivity. I also learned that binary uses powers of two and
    is used because computers represent data using on/off states.
  </p>

  <p>
    Next week I want to add one more project entry with a clearer description and links,
    and improve my navigation so visitors can reach sections faster.
